# Problem Statement: Build a RAG System by using LangChain or LLaMA Index

The assignment aims to develop a robust generative search system, 
utilizing the principles of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), 
to effectively address inquiries from diverse policy documents. 

The system will leverage either LangChain or LlamaIndex frameworks 
to facilitate the creation of a comprehensive generative search application. 
The key objectives include implementing semantic search techniques, 
integrating re-ranking mechanisms, and optimizing caching strategies 
to minimize latency and enhance the accuracy of responses. 

Through this project, students will gain hands-on experience in 
deploying advanced natural language processing models to tackle real-world 
challenges in document retrieval and question answering within the insurance domain.

## Why LangChain is an ideal framework?


LangChain is an ideal framework for resolving a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system due to several key factors:

1. **Integration of Language Models:** LangChain seamlessly integrates powerful language models, such as GPT, allowing for advanced natural language processing capabilities. These models are essential for generating contextually relevant responses in a generative search system.

2. **Flexible Architecture:** LangChain offers a flexible and modular architecture, enabling easy customization and extension of functionalities. This flexibility allows developers to tailor the RAG system to specific requirements and adapt to evolving needs.

3. **Efficient Retrieval Mechanisms:** LangChain incorporates efficient retrieval mechanisms that facilitate the retrieval of relevant information from a large corpus of documents. This is crucial for the retrieval component of the RAG system, ensuring that the generated responses are based on accurate and comprehensive information.

4. **Advanced Semantic Understanding:** LangChain leverages advanced semantic understanding techniques, enabling the system to comprehend the nuances of user queries and document content. This enhances the system's ability to generate contextually appropriate responses and improve overall user satisfaction.

5. **Scalability and Performance:** LangChain is designed for scalability and high performance, capable of handling large volumes of data and user queries efficiently. This ensures that the RAG system can effectively scale to meet the demands of growing user bases and increasing data volumes.

Overall, LangChain's integration of powerful language models, flexible architecture, efficient retrieval mechanisms, advanced semantic understanding, and scalability make it an ideal framework for building and deploying a Retrieval Augmented Generation system.
